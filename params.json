{"body":"## Welcome to the Tarlton's Jests Digital Edition project\r\nThis is an experiment in creating a crowdsourced TEI-compliant digital edition of Tarlton's Jests, a 16th century collection of anecdotes about Richard Tarlton, the Elizabethan comic actor and founding member of the Queen's Men performance troupe.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this experiment is to see what happens when a digital edition is released into the wild while it is still being marked up. Research questions and objectives include:\r\n* How can a collaborative source such as github enhance (or detract from) the editorial process?\r\n* What opportunities exist for trans-disciplinary collaboration on this type of digital project?\r\n* Where does editorial control end and chaos begin?\r\n\r\nIn addition to contributing to the mark-up, please add tags and/or suggestions about how to expand the value of this text to interested parties. \r\n\r\n## Author\r\nFor more information about the Tarlton's Jests Digital Edition project contact Diane Jakacki (@djakacki) or visit [The Tarlton Project](http://tarltonproject.org).\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
